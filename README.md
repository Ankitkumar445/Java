Java Project 
Description:
I have provided a full programs of java and all type of questions in it .I am a beginner in github so please ignore my mistakes but i'll look after it and make changes into it time by time.

Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its robustness, portability, and performance. Here are some key features of Java:
Key Features of Java --------
Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it models the real world into objects and classes, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

Platform-Independent:Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any system equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java programs highly portable.

Simple:Java's syntax is designed to be easy to learn and use, making it accessible for beginners. It removes many complexities of C++ such as pointers and multiple inheritance.

Secure:Java has several built-in security features, including bytecode verification, sandboxing, and a robust security manager, which help in developing secure applications.

Robust:Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors, runtime checking, and eliminating error-prone situations by using strong memory management and exception handling.

Multithreaded:Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads to run concurrently, improving the performance of applications, especially on multi-core systems.

High Performance:Java's performance is enhanced through the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and various optimizations within the JVM.

Distributed:Java has extensive networking capabilities, allowing for the development of distributed applications that can communicate over a network.

Dynamic:Java can dynamically link in new class libraries, methods, and objects. This dynamic behavior is essential for creating extensible and adaptable applications.

Automatic Memory Management:Java features garbage collection, which automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and other related issues.

Rich Standard Library:Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, from data structures and algorithms to networking and graphical user interface (GUI) development.

These features make Java a versatile and powerful programming language suitable for a wide range of applications, from web and mobile development to large-scale enterprise systems.
